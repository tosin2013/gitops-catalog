# Red Hat OpenShift AI

Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) is a machine-learning-as-a-service
platform built on Red Hat's Kubernetes-based OpenShift Container Platform 
integrating a collection of open source projects.

The RHOAI operator allows users to install and manage RHOAI components.
Users can mix and match tools from each project to fulfill the needs of
their use case. Each of the projects share some components, but can be
mostly seen as an extension of each other to provide as complete a solution
as possible for enterprise users.

### Components

* Notebook Controller - Open source multi-user notebook platform w/ GPU support
* RHOAI Dashboard - Dashboard for Red Hat OpenShift AI
